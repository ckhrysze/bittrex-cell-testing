## Bittrex Thingy

### WIP

Just playing around with [cell.js](https://www.celljs.org/), some javascript that lets you write web pages in json.

The bittrex.html file can be opened in Chrome. [Disable CORS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en) to let it call the Bittrex api and load a list of market summaries.

The demo.html file is a few test things made with cell.js.
